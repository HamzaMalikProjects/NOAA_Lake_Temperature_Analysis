# NOAA Lake Temperature Analysis
The NOAA Lake Temperature Analysis Program is a software tool developed specifically for analyzing temperature data in the Great Lakes region of Canada. It is implemented using the C programming language and incorporates various concepts such as arrays, pointers, functions, and sorting algorithms. The program utilizes real-time data obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for the period of 2019 to 2020.
With its comprehensive set of features, the program offers valuable insights into multiple aspects of the temperature data. It can calculate average yearly temperatures, identify temperature patterns specific to different seasons, determine the highest and lowest temperatures recorded, and highlight the warmest water temperatures along with their corresponding dates for each of the six lakes. Moreover, the program can calculate the warmest water temperature during summer and winter, as well as the number of days when the Great Lakes are frozen.
By employing advanced algorithms and leveraging the capabilities of the C programming language, the program provides accurate and detailed analysis that is of great significance to researchers, environmentalists, and policymakers studying the climate of the Great Lakes. Its user-friendly interface facilitates easy interaction and efficient data organization, enabling users to make informed decisions and gain a deeper understanding of the region's climate dynamics.
